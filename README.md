Easyclimate-backend is the powerhouse behind the Easyclimate front-end package, providing a suite of high-performance, 
low-level functions for climate data analysis. Implemented in languages like ``Fortran`` and ``C``, 
these functions ensure that your climate data processing is both efficient and accurate.

## What is easyclimate-backend?

The easyclimate-backend is designed to handle the heavy lifting for Easyclimate, 
allowing the front-end package to offer a user-friendly interface for climate analysis. By leveraging the speed and efficiency of ``Fortran`` and ``C``, 
The easyclimate-backend makes sure that even the most computationally intensive tasks are managed seamlessly.
